## Download Guide

Get the .zip file included in our releases tab. Inside you will find a Windows and OS X executable, along with a printable version of the play deck, along with the score sheet. You will need to print both of those in order to play. (We also strongly recommend that you paste the cards on actual cardboard play cards, since keeping the card secret is crucial to the gameplay!)

The game is suited for play with a DualShock controller (either 3 or 4). We recommend installing DS4Windows if you have a DualShock 4 in order to have proper button mapping. The game also works with Xbox controllers, although the prompts will still display PlayStation shapes instead of ABXY. Sorry!

Thanks for trying out our game, and have fun!

## Rules of Play

One player (the main player) takes the controller and faces AWAY from the screen.
EVERYONE ELSE (the spectators) draw a card without looking at it. Instead, they hold it on their forehead so that everyone else can see it.

The main player has to eliminate as many players as he can within the time limit of a round. The spectators have to stay alive for as many rounds as possible.

The screen will prompt to you four buttons (either the arrows, shapes or triggers). Each button also has a secondary icon indicating which button type will come next if this button is picked. Also, the background color will change to another color after every input.

The Mainplayer will be able to press a button succesfully only when his controller is vibrating. Beware, if you wait for too long, your time will count down way faster!

When the main player inputs a button, if both that button and the current background color matches someone's card, this person is ELIMINATED. After a game round, all combinations that were pressed by the Mainplayer will be displayed again.

Convince the main player to press buttons that will eliminate others, 
he is supposed to ask YOU what to do next!

After a round, every player that was not eliminated and the Mainplayer gain 1 point for every other player that was eliminated. The game goes on until everyone has been the main player, then the player with the most points is the winner!
